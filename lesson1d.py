# create a python program tht is able to calculate the simple intrest given the the principle as 50000, rate as 5% and time as 8 years. SI =(p *R* t)/100
# Given values
principal = 50000
rate = 5        
time = 8     

simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100

print("Simple Interest:", simple_interest)
