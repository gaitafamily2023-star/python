# Python while loop.
#  While loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true. The syntax of a while loop in python is as follows:
"""
initiallization of a variable,
while keyword,
followed by the condition/statement to be evaluated,
followed by a full colon(:),
code to be printed out,
increment/decrement
"""

number = 0
while number < 5:
    print("hello Kelvin", number)
    number = number + 1

print('==================================')
number = 50
while number < 70:
    print(number)
    number = number + 2
